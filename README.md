# Forensic Analysis of Android Privacy Browser

Step 1: Setup a Android X86 on Virtual Machine.<br>
Step 2: Install Privacy Browser.<br>
Step 3: Perform test script on browser as per report.<br>
Step 4: Close the browser and shut down the VM.<br>
Step 5: Use the Virtual Disk of VM to generate encase forensic file using FTK Imager Tool.<br>
Step 6: Use Bulk Extractor tool to generate raw data results in the form of text-based artifact files.<br>
<br>
<br>
Command to generate text based artifact files:
bulk_extractor -o output-directory target-image <br>


Artifacts_Terminal_View.py uses this text based artifact folder as input and searches for the browser artifacts generated by browser while running our test script. The output is printed in Terminal<br>

Browser_Excel_Generates.py does the same activity but outputs the browser artifacts results properly for analysis in excel sheets<br>

Please go through Report.pdf for detail explaination of lab environment setup, Browser Test script and code explanation <br>

The report also has analysis on 8 popular browsers.
